Asynchronous example
====================

This article will explain how to use asynchronous messages with Symfony. We will
assume that you know the basics of SimpleBus, CQRS and event sourcing. This is
just **an** example. you could of course have a working asynchronous set up with
SimpleBus and Symfony in a different way and with different libraries.

Installation
------------

Install Simplebus, async support, message serializer and the RabbitMQBundle.

.. code-block::  bash

    composer require simple-bus/asynchronous-bundle simple-bus/symfony-bridge simple-bus/doctrine-orm-bridge simple-bus/jms-serializer-bundle-bridge simple-bus/rabbitmq-bundle-bridge

Register the bundles in Symfony's AppKernel.php

.. code-block::  php

    class AppKernel extends Kernel
    {
        public function registerBundles()
        {
            $bundles = array(
                ...
                new SimpleBus\SymfonyBridge\SimpleBusCommandBusBundle()
                new SimpleBus\SymfonyBridge\SimpleBusEventBusBundle()
                new SimpleBus\SymfonyBridge\DoctrineOrmBridgeBundle()
                new SimpleBus\AsynchronousBundle\SimpleBusAsynchronousBundle()
                new SimpleBus\RabbitMQBundleBridge\SimpleBusRabbitMQBundleBridgeBundle()
                new SimpleBus\JMSSerializerBundleBridge\SimpleBusJMSSerializerBundleBridgeBundle()
                new OldSound\RabbitMqBundle\OldSoundRabbitMqBundle()
                new JMS\SerializerBundle\JMSSerializerBundle()
            )
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }

Configuration
-------------

There is quite a lot of moving parts in this configuration. Most if it is to configure
the queue and make sure RabbitMqBundle is aware of SimpleBus' consumers and producers.

.. code-block:: yaml

    // app/config/config.yml
    parameters:
      app.command_queue: 'commands'
      app.event_queue: 'events'

    simple_bus_rabbit_mq_bundle_bridge:
      commands:
        producer_service_id: old_sound_rabbit_mq.asynchronous_commands_producer
      events:
        producer_service_id: old_sound_rabbit_mq.asynchronous_events_producer

    simple_bus_asynchronous:
      events:
        strategy: 'predefined'

    old_sound_rabbit_mq:
      connections:
        default:
          host:     "127.0.0.1"
          port:     5672
          user:     'guest'
          password: 'guest'
          vhost:    '/'
          lazy:     false
          connection_timeout: 3
          read_write_timeout: 3

          # requires php-amqplib v2.4.1+ and PHP5.4+
          keepalive: false

          # requires php-amqplib v2.4.1+
          heartbeat: 0
      producers:
        asynchronous_commands:
          connection:       default
          exchange_options: { name: '%app.command_queue%', type: "direct" }

        asynchronous_events:
          connection:       default
          exchange_options: { name: '%app.event_queue%', type: "direct" }

      consumers:
        asynchronous_commands:
          connection:       default
          exchange_options: { name: '%app.command_queue%', type: direct }
          queue_options:    { name: '%app.command_queue%' }
          callback:         simple_bus.rabbit_mq_bundle_bridge.commands_consumer

        asynchronous_events:
          connection:       default
          exchange_options: { name: '%app.command_queue%', type: direct }
          queue_options:    { name: '%app.command_queue%' }
          callback:         simple_bus.rabbit_mq_bundle_bridge.events_consumer

Usage
-----

The first thing we need to do is to create a command and tag the command handler as
asynchronous. You do that with the ``asynchronous_command_handler`` tag.

.. code-block::  yaml

    services:
      command_handler.email.SendEmailToAllUsers:
        class: App\Message\CommandHandler\Email\SendEmailToAllUsersHandler
        autowire: true
        tags:
          - { name: 'asynchronous_command_handler', handles: App\Message\Command\Email\SendEmailToAllUsers }

You can of course to the very same with events subscribers. When tagging event subscribers
as asynchronous you should use the  ``asynchronous_event_subscriber`` tag.

SimpleBus will automatically make sure that the messages get put on the queue. There
is not special way you would create and handle asynchronous messages.

.. code-block::  php

    $this->container->get('command_bus')->handle(new SendEmailToAllUsers());

Consuming Messages
------------------

There is different strategies you could use to consume messages from the queue.
One simple solution is to run the following commands. They will start listening
on incoming messages and consume them. If you are using these commands it is recommended
to set up ``supervisord``.

.. code-block::  bash

    php app/console rabbitmq:consume asynchronous_events
    php app/console rabbitmq:consume asynchronous_commands
