# Routing

## Customizing queue names

```yaml
simple_bus_bernard_bundle_bridge:
    commands: my_queue_for_commands
    events: my_queue_for_events
```

All commands and events will be routed to _my_queue_for_commands_ and _my_queue_for_events_ respectively.

## Resolving queue name automatically

It is a common practice to have a separate queue for each asynchronous job type.

```yaml
simple_bus_bernard_bundle_bridge:
    commands:
        queue_name: my_queue_for_commands
        queue_name_resolver: class_based
```

Let's say you have `SendEmailCommand` and `BounceEmailCommand`. `SendEmailCommand` will be routed to _send_email_command_ queue and `BounceEmailCommand` to _bounce_email_command_ queue.

Same config option works for events.

## Map message to queue manually

Class based approach works fine, when amount of async messages is not high. Remember, you need to run `./app/console bernard:consume <queue-name>` for each queue. _SimpleBusBernardBundleBridge_ supports mapped queue name resolver:

```yaml
simple_bus_bernard_bundle_bridge:
    commands:
        queue_name: other_messages # Default queue for commands
        queue_name_resolver: mapped
        queues_map:
            My\MailerBundle\Model\Command\BounceEmailCommand: mailer_webhook
            My\MailerBundle\Model\Command\OpenEmailCommand:   mailer_webhook
            My\MailerBundle\Model\Command\SendEmailCommand:   mailer_delivery
            My\MailerBundle\Model\Command\ResendEmailCommand: mailer_delivery
    events:
        queue_name: other_messages # Default queue for events
        queue_name_resolver: mapped
        queues_map:
            My\MediaBundle\Model\Event\MediaCreatedEvent:  media_processor
            My\MediaBundle\Model\Event\FormatCreatedEvent: media_processor
```

In above example we use 3 queues for 6 async messages. Commands and events not specified in the map will be routed to _other_messages_ queue.

## Custom queue resolver

You can specify your own queue resolver by implementing `SimpleBus\Asynchronous\Routing\RoutingKeyResolver` interface. Register the service in container and update the config:

```yaml
simple_bus_bernard_bundle_bridge:
    commands:
        queue_name_resolver: my.custom.queue.resolver
    events: queue_for_events
```

Above example uses custom queue resolver for commands, however, all events routed to _queue_for_events_ queue.
